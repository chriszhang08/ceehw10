The histogram plot closely resembles an inversely exponential graph, very similar to what the PDF looked liked from homework 9.

## Qusetion 4b
Average Trip Time for Route A = 3.851189021192349 hours\
Average Trip Time for Route B = 4.5373456085525 hours\
Expected Value for Route A = 4 hours\
Expected Value for Route B = 4.5 hours\
Experimental trip times are very close to the expected values.

## Question 4c
Probability for Route A that it takes longer than 12 hours = 0.06\
Probability for Route B that it takes longer than 12 hours = 0.034\
Calculated probability for Route A from homework 9 = 0.0498\
Calculated probability for Route B from homework 9 = 0.0186\
Experimental probabilities are kinda close to the calculated probabilities, hits the general ballpark.

## Question 5b
Mean value of Delta = 0.00798002702247005\
Theoretical mean value of Delta = 4.0236 * F / k = 0.0080472\
These values are very close to each other. To make it even closer, run the experiment more.
